# Architecture

This document holds the model and the reasoning: how the tree is shaped and why.
The rules that follow from it — what you may import from where, where a file
goes, what a linter will reject — live in one place:

**[coding-guidelines.md](coding-guidelines.md)** — the concrete rulebook, every
rule tagged *lint-enforced* or *human-checked* and named after the file that
motivated it. Read that before writing code.

See also [testing.md](testing.md) for what must be tested.

## The model

The app is built as vertical feature slices. Two directories carry the weight:

- `src/components` — the design system: generic, reusable building blocks.
- `src/features/<feature>` — one self-contained feature per folder.

Everything else is glue: `src/app` for routing, `src/lib` for the small set of
code the app and the groove generator under `scripts/` must both run.

A feature owns everything it needs in one folder — its UI, its hooks, its state,
its generated data and its business logic — and exposes one public surface,
`index.ts`. Its tests live inside it. The point of the shape is that a slice is a
unit you can reason about, hand to someone else, or delete, without tracing it
through the rest of the app.

The design system is the other half of that bargain. Its components are reusable
*by construction*: driven by props, holding no app state, knowing no domain
concept. A primitive that has learned about grooves is no longer a primitive, and
the feature it learned about is no longer removable.

## Why the dependency direction is the load-bearing part

Almost every rule in the guidelines is one arrow in a graph the app is allowed to
draw. The direction is what makes the slices work:

- The design system may use shared utilities, but never a feature. That one-way
  dependency is what keeps it reusable.
- Features do not reach each other. There is no sideways arrow, so anything two
  slices need moves *up* into `src/lib` or `src/components` rather than making
  one slice a dependency of the other.
- `src/lib` is a leaf — it imports nothing from the app. That is not tidiness: it
  is exactly what lets the groove generator under `scripts/` import it by
  relative path with no bundler and no `@/` alias in play.

The guidelines draw the full graph and name the ESLint zone behind each arrow.

## Every feature must be removable

This is the standard the shape exists to serve:

> Delete `src/features/<feature>/`, delete its route folder under `src/app`,
> remove its one registration entry — and the app still builds and runs.

Removability is a test of coupling, not a plan to delete anything. A feature
whose internals have leaked into the route, into the design system, or into a
sibling cannot be moved, rewritten or replaced in one step either — deletion is
just the cheapest way to notice.

What keeps it true: a feature's inbound references are countable on one hand —
its route(s) in `src/app`, and, where it must appear in shared UI, a single
registration point such as a nav entry. Its state, its types and its styles stay
inside the folder. Its consumers, tests included, know only its `index.ts`.

Before merging a feature, ask: could I `rm -rf` this folder and still get a clean
build? If not, something leaked, and the guidelines will name what.
